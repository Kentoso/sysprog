3 // Number of characters in alphabet

a b c // Characters in the alphabet

3 // Number of states in alphabet

0 1 2 // States of the automaton

0 // Initial state is state 0

2 // Number of final states
0 2 // Final states are 0 and 2

6 // Number of transitions

0 a 1 // Transition: from state 0 to state 1 when reading 'a'
0 b 0 // Transition: from state 0 to state 0 when reading 'b'
1 a 1 // Transition: from state 1 to state 1 when reading 'a'
1 b 2 // Transition: from state 1 to state 2 when reading 'b'
2 a 1 // Transition: from state 2 to state 1 when reading 'a'
2 b 0 // Transition: from state 2 to state 0 when reading 'b'
